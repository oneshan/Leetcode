# Follow up for "Search in Rotated Sorted Array":
# What if duplicates are allowed?
# 
# Would this affect the run-time complexity? How and why?
# 
# 
# Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown
# to you beforehand.
# 
# (i.e., 0 1 2 4 5 6 7 might become 4 5 6 7 0 1 2).
# 
# Write a function to determine if a given target is in the array.
# 
# The array may contain duplicates.
