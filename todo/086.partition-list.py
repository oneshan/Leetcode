# Given a linked list and a value x, partition it such that all nodes less than
# x come before nodes greater than or equal to x.
# 
# 
# You should preserve the original relative order of the nodes in each of the
# two partitions.
# 
# 
# For example,
# Given 1->4->3->2->5->2 and x = 3,
# return 1->2->2->4->3->5.

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode(object):

#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None
