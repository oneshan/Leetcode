#
# Given a pattern and a string str, find if str follows the same pattern.
# ⁠Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a
# letter in pattern and a non-empty word in str.
# 
# Examples:
# 
# pattern = "abba", str = "dog cat cat dog" should return true.
# pattern = "abba", str = "dog cat cat fish" should return false.
# pattern = "aaaa", str = "dog cat cat dog" should return false.
# pattern = "abba", str = "dog dog dog dog" should return false.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Notes:
# You may assume pattern contains only lowercase letters, and str contains
# lowercase letters separated by a single space.
#
