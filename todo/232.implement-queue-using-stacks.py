# 
# Implement the following operations of a queue using stacks.
# 
# 
# push(x) -- Push element x to the back of queue.
# 
# 
# pop() -- Removes the element from in front of queue.
# 
# 
# peek() -- Get the front element.
# 
# 
# empty() -- Return whether the queue is empty.
# 
# 
# Notes:
# 
# You must use only standard operations of a stack -- which means only push to
# top, peek/pop from top, size, and is empty operations are valid.
# Depending on your language, stack may not be supported natively. You may
# simulate a stack by using a list or deque (double-ended queue), as long as
# you use only standard operations of a stack.
# You may assume that all operations are valid (for example, no pop or peek
# operations will be called on an empty queue).
