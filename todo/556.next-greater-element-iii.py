# Given a positive 32-bit integer n, you need to find the smallest 32-bit
# integer which has exactly the same digits existing in the integer n and is
# greater in value than n. If no such positive 32-bit integer exists, you need
# to return -1.

# Example 1:
# 
# Input: 12
# Output: 21

# Example 2:
# 
# Input: 21
# Output: -1
