# Given a sorted array and a target value, return the index if the target is
# found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in
# order.
# 
# You may assume no duplicates in the array.
# 
# 
# Here are few examples.
# [1,3,5,6], 5 → 2
# [1,3,5,6], 2 → 1
# [1,3,5,6], 7 → 4
# [1,3,5,6], 0 → 0
