#
# Implement a basic calculator to evaluate a simple expression string.
# 
# The expression string contains only non-negative integers, +, -, *, /
# operators and empty spaces  . The integer division should truncate toward
# zero.
# 
# You may assume that the given expression is always valid.
# 
# Some examples:
# 
# "3+2*2" = 7
# " 3/2 " = 1
# " 3+5 / 2 " = 5
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Note: Do not use the eval built-in library function.
#

# Credits:Special thanks to @ts for adding this problem and creating all test
# cases.
