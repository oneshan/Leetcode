#
# Given a binary search tree, write a function kthSmallest to find the kth
# smallest element in it.
# 
# Note: 
# You may assume k is always valid, 1 ? k ? BST's total elements.
# 
# Follow up:
# What if the BST is modified (insert/delete operations) often and you need to
# find the kth smallest frequently? How would you optimize the kthSmallest
# routine?
