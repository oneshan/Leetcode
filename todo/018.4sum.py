#
# Given an array S of n integers, are there elements a, b, c, and d in S such
# that a + b + c + d = target? Find all unique quadruplets in the array which
# gives the sum of target.
# 
# Note: The solution set must not contain duplicate quadruplets.
# 
# 
# 
# For example, given array S = [1, 0, -1, 0, -2, 2], and target = 0.
# 
# A solution set is:
# [
# ⁠ [-1,  0, 0, 1],
# ⁠ [-2, -1, 1, 2],
# ⁠ [-2,  0, 0, 2]
# ]
