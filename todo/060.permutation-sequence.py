#
# The set [1,2,3,â€¦,n] contains a total of n! unique permutations.
# 
# By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order,
# We get the following sequence (ie, for n = 3):
# 
# "123"
# "132"
# "213"
# "231"
# "312"
# "321"
# 
# 
# 
# Given n and k, return the kth permutation sequence.
# 
# Note: Given n will be between 1 and 9 inclusive.
