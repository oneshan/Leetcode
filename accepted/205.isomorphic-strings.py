#
# Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.
#
# Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.
#
# All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while
# preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same
# character but a character may map to itself.
#
# For example,
# Given "egg", "add", return true.
#
# Given "foo", "bar", return false.
#
# Given "paper", "title", return true.
#
# Note:
# You may assume both s and t have the same length.
