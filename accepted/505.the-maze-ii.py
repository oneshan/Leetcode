#
# There is a ball in a maze with empty spaces and walls. The ball can go
# through empty spaces by rolling up, down, left or right, but it won't stop
# rolling until hitting a wall. When the ball stops, it could choose the next
# direction.
#
# Given the ball's start position, the destination and the maze, find the
# shortest distance for the ball to stop at the destination. The distance is
# defined by the number of empty spaces traveled by the ball from the start
# position (excluded) to the destination (included). If the ball cannot stop at
# the destination, return -1.
#
# The maze is represented by a binary 2D array. 1 means the wall and 0 means
# the empty space. You may assume that the borders of the maze are all walls.
# The start and destination coordinates are represented by row and column
# indexes.
#
#
# Example 1
#
# Input 1: a maze represented by a 2D array
#
# 0 0 1 0 0
# 0 0 0 0 0
# 0 0 0 1 0
# 1 1 0 1 1
# 0 0 0 0 0
#
# Input 2: start coordinate (rowStart, colStart) = (0, 4)
# Input 3: destination coordinate (rowDest, colDest) = (4, 4)
#
# Output: 12
# Explanation: One shortest way is : left -> down -> left -> down -> right ->
# down -> right.
# ‚Å†            The total distance is 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 12.

#
#
# Example 2
#
# Input 1: a maze represented by a 2D array
#
# 0 0 1 0 0
# 0 0 0 0 0
# 0 0 0 1 0
# 1 1 0 1 1
# 0 0 0 0 0
#
# Input 2: start coordinate (rowStart, colStart) = (0, 4)
# Input 3: destination coordinate (rowDest, colDest) = (3, 2)
#
# Output: -1
# Explanation: There is no way for the ball to stop at the destination.
#
#
#
#
# Note:
#
# There is only one ball and one destination in the maze.
# Both the ball and the destination exist on an empty space, and they will not
# be at the same position initially.
# The given maze does not contain border (like the red rectangle in the example
# pictures), but you could assume the border of the maze are all walls.
# The maze contains at least 2 empty spaces, and both the width and height of
# the maze won't exceed 100.
