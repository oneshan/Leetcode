#
# ‚Å†Given an integer array with all positive numbers and no duplicates, find the
# number of possible combinations that add up to a positive integer target.
#
# Example:
#
# nums = [1, 2, 3]
# target = 4
#
# The possible combination ways are:
# (1, 1, 1, 1)
# (1, 1, 2)
# (1, 2, 1)
# (1, 3)
# (2, 1, 1)
# (2, 2)
# (3, 1)
#
# Note that different sequences are counted as different combinations.
#
# Therefore the output is 7.
#
#
#
# Follow up:
# What if negative numbers are allowed in the given array?
# How does it change the problem?
# What limitation we need to add to the question to allow negative numbers? 
#
# Credits:Special thanks to @pbrother for adding this problem and creating all
# test cases.
